# Mental Health in the Workplace
This is a data visualization project where data was cleaned and transformed using R, and a dashboard was designed in R Studio. The dashboard is hosted on shinyapp.io and is currently live. You can [view the live dashboard here](https://cheetahskita.shinyapps.io/mental-health-survey/).

According the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), mental health issues cause some of the greatest burdens on the country as a whole. Open Sourcing Mental Illness Ltd. is a non-profit with the mission of raising awareness around mental wellness in the technology sector. As part of their mission, OSMI has conducted a survey about mental health in the tech industry since 2014. (The 2014 survey is popular on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey).)

Due to the size and complexity of the suvery data, no had yet tried to collect all seven years of survey data into a single data source. Therefore, I saw an opportunity to bring all this data into an easy-to-interpret dashboard. By visualizing the data in this way, you can more clearly look for relevant trends in the survey. This visualization led to relveant business and marketing findings that I have [written into a blog post](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/r-visualization/mental-health-in-the-workplace/) that goes into greater detail.
